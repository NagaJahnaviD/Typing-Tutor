The cat is playing with a ball of yarn.
She likes to jump and run in the garden.
The sun is bright and warm today.
Birds are singing on the trees.
He drinks a glass of milk every morning.
They went to the park to play.
I enjoy reading books in my free time.
We have a small dog named Max.
The flowers are blooming in the spring.
